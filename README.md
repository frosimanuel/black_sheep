# Black Sheep ðŸ¤˜

### AI Generated NFT collection

An example app for the black sheep minting process developed with help of [Juno](https://juno.build) using [React](https://react.dev).

It's made as a mock-up app for a demo presentation.

## âœ¨ Features 

- Internet Identity login
- NFID for login abstraction and accessibility
- Transformation of user input into atributes via a model using HTTPS
- Merge those atributes with another model for image generation serverside. 
- Upload generated image to the storage canister and mint.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
